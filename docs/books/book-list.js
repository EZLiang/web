    "description": "Equally appealing to beginners and to the mathematically adept, this book bridges the humanities and sciences to explore applications behind computers, cell phones, measurement of astronomical distance, cell growth, and other areas. Eight fascinating examples show how understanding certain topics in advanced mathematics requires nothing more than arithmetic and common sense. Each chapter begins with a question about strings consisting of nothing more than two letters, and every such question raises intriguing problems to be explored and solved. ",

Generations of readers have relished Polya's deft-indeed, brilliant-instructions on stripping away irrelevancies and going straight to the heart of the problem.",

In studying number theory from such a perspective, mathematics majors are spared repetition and provided with new insights, while other students benefit from the consequent simplicity of the proofs for many theorems.\nAmong the topics covered in this accessible, carefully designed introduction are multiplicativity-divisibility, including the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, combinatorial and computational number theory, congruences, arithmetic functions, primitive roots and prime numbers. Later chapters offer lucid treatments of quadratic congruences, additivity (including partition theory) and geometric number theory.\nOf particular importance in this text is the author's emphasis on the value of numerical examples in number theory and the role of computers in obtaining such examples. Exercises provide opportunities for constructing numerical tables with or without a computer. Students can then derive conjectures from such numerical tables, after which relevant theorems will seem natural and well-motivated.",

Each section consists of definitions, theorems, proofs, examples and exercises. An effort has been made to make the statement of each theorem so concise that the student can see at a glance the essential hypotheses and conclusions.<br>\nFor this second edition, the author has improved the treatment of Stieltjes integrals to make it more useful to the reader less than familiar with the basic facts about the Riemann integral. In addition the material on series has been augmented by the inclusion of the method of partial summation of the Schwarz-Holder inequalities, and of additional results about power series.
