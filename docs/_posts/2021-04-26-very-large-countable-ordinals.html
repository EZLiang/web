<p>It's been over three months since my last post, and I've got
    something good. (This is also my first post about ordinals,
    which is surprising, given my intrest in them.)</p>
    <h1>Evin's \(\mathcal{V}\)</h1>
    <p>A powerful extension of Kleene's \(\mathcal{O}\)</p>
    <h2>What the heck is Kleene's \(\mathcal{O}\)?</h2>

    <h2>What the heck is Evin's \(\mathcal{V}\)?</h2>
    <p>Answer: This thing:</p>
    <p>We simply extend Kleene's \(\mathcal{O}\) by adding some
    &ldquo;bespoke&rdquo; ordinals. We recursively define a system
    of notations as follows:<br />
    Of course, like Kleene's \(\mathcal{O}\), we enumerate all computable functions \(f_i\) from natural numbers to natural numbers. We recursively define \(K_{a,b,c,\ldots}\), the set of all valid notations, \(&lt;_{a,b,c,\ldots}\), the ordering on those notations, \(V_{a,b,c,\ldots}\), a function assinging ordinals to notations, and \(i_{a,b,c,\ldots}\), a large ordinal. 
    
    <br />Define a sequence to be less than another when it is lexicographically less when reversed.
    
    <br />In addition, for any sequence \(a,b,c,\ldots\), it turns out that for all sufficiently large sequences \(d,e,f,\ldots\) less than it, the value of \(V_{d,e,f,\ldots}(n)\) is constant. We define \(V^\prime_{a,b,c,\ldots}(n)\) to be that value.
    
    <br />Note: sequence terms can be ordinals.
    <ul>
    <li>\(0\in K_{a,b,c,\ldots}\) and \(V_{a,b,c,\ldots}(0)=0\) for all \(a,b,c,\ldots\)</li>
    
    <li>If \(n\in K_{a,b,c,\ldots}\) and \(V_{a,b,c,\ldots}(n)=\alpha\), then \(2^n\in K_{a,b,c,\ldots}\), \(V_{a,b,c,\ldots}(2^n)=\alpha+1\), and \(n&lt;_{a,b,c,\ldots}2^n\)</li>
    
    <li>If for all natural numbers \(n\), \(f_i(n)\in K_{a,b,c,\ldots}\) and \(f_i(n)&lt;_{a,b,c,\ldots}f_i(n+1)\), then \(3\cdot 5^i\in K_{a,b,c,\ldots}\), for all \(k\), \(f_i(k)&lt;_{a,b,c,\ldots}3\cdot 5^i\), \(V_{a,b,c,\ldots}(i)=\sup V_{a,b,c,\ldots}(f_i(k))\), and \(V_{a,b,c,\ldots}(i)[n]=V_{a,b,c,\ldots}(f_i(n))\)</li>
    
    <li>\(&lt;_{a,b,c,\ldots}\) is transisitive.</li>
    
    <li>\(i_{a,b,c,\ldots}\) is the smallest ordinal not of the form \(V_{d,e,f,\ldots}(n)\) for \(n\in K_{d,e,f,\ldots}\) for some sequence \(d,e,f,\ldots\) less than \(a,b,c,\ldots\).</li>
    
    <li>For all \(d,e,f,\ldots\) such that \(V^\prime_{a,b,c,\ldots}(d),\ldots\) is less than \(a,b,c,\ldots\), let \(n=7^d\cdot 11^e\cdot 13^f\cdot\ldots\). Then \(n\in K_{a,b,c,\ldots}\), \(V_{a,b,c,\ldots}(n)=i_{V^\prime_{a,b,c,\ldots}(d),\ldots}\), and for all \(i\) such that \(i\in K_{V^\prime_{a,b,c,\ldots}(d),\ldots}\), \(i&lt;_{a,b,c,\ldots}n\)</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>Now finally, we can define the (mostly) complete fake ordinal notation.
    \(\mathcal{K}\) is the union of all \(K_{a,b,c,\ldots}\). For all numbers \(n\) and sufficiently large sequences \(a,b,c,\ldots\), the value of \(V_{a,b,c,\ldots}(n)\) is constant, and \(\mathcal{V}(n)\) is defined to be that value. Finally, fundamental sequences and order relationships are similarly constant for sufficiently large sequences, which define the order and fs's of \(\mathcal{V}\)</p>
    <p>Now, of course, the obvious step is to define the the supremum of \(\mathcal{V}\), which by analogy with the Church-Kleene ordinal we may denote \(\omega_1^\mathfrak{E}\). Of course, its fs is analogous to that of \(\omega_1^\mathfrak{CK}\), its fs must be the sequence of \(\mathcal{V}(n)\) which are larger than all \(\mathcal{V}(m)\) for all \(m\) less than \(n\). Now we can choose an enumeration of functions. I propose to do the following: enumerate all <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck">brainfuck</a> programs with no IO commands, first in order of length, and then lexicographic order with <code>+</code> preceding <code>-</code> preceding <code>[</code> preceding <code>]</code> preceding <code>&lt;</code> preceding <code>&gt;</code>. Then \(f_i(n)\) is the final value in the first cell when the \(i\)th program is run starting with \(n\) in the first cell, then we discard all functions which are not functions.</p>
    
    <p>...aaaaaand its massive uncomputable number time! \(f_{\omega_1^\mathfrak{E}}(3\uparrow\uparrow\uparrow 3)\) should work pretty nicely...
        <br /><b>NOTE:</b> please help define fs's for \(i_{a,b,c,\ldots}\).
