<h1>The ZFC trolley problem</h1>
<p>There is a trolley with a single driver on it.
It contains 748 distinct coins, and an infinite strip of paper.
There is a supply of markers to color the strip.
One of the coins is on a square of the strip, and all the squares are uncolored.</p>
<p>If you pull the lever, the trolley will be diverted and start going around a loop.
Every time it passes a certain point on the loop, the driver will update the coin and strip according to <a href="https://turingmachinesimulator.com/shared/vgimygpuwi">these rules</a>.
If it ever stops, it will fall into the black hole in the center of the loop.
Due to the black hole an infinite number of steps happen in a second.
If it never halts, it will escape after that time, and continue on another track with eight people tied to it.</p>
<p>If you do not pull the lever, it will continue to go forward on the track with five people tied to the it.</p>
<p>Do you pull the lever?</p>
